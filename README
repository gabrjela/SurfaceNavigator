The project is set up to be built by Eclipse.

Short description:
SurfaceNavigator is a demo for how to create a surface larger than the screen of the device, how to implement drag gestures over it and 
pinch to zoom.

Surface has been drawn as a grid of 30x30 cells, on which you can place cross marks - current example is the start point for a Tic tac toe game.
